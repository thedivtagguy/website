My biggest portfolio pieces were built not with the end goal of having it in my portfolio but because I wanted to create something for myself. Don\u2019t worry if it doesn\u2019t align with your major, nobody outside Yelahanka gives a shit about what CAC or BSSD mean. My friend from IAIDP successfully interned in animation.

Your explanation isn\u2019t clear enough? Rewrite. Don\u2019t let your ego get in the way of improvements. If you find yourself explaining why you did something that more than 3 people can\u2019t understand, reconsider. If it needs your verbal justification, it's not good enough. Recruiters aren\u2019t going to ponder your work like contemporary arts faculty. But at the same time, stick to your guns when you feel like you really need to and learn when to ignore comments. Log kahenge, logon ka kaam hai kehna."},{heading:"Website? BEHANCE? PDF? Illustrator? Indesign?????? WHAT DO I USE?",text:"Dude relax. Context matters. Applying for a coding internship? Website is a no-brainer. Film? You\u2019re not going to be sending a zine then are you. Most other places are happy with a PDF. I made my portfolio in half an hour on Canva. As long as your content is in place, the medium shouldn\u2019t matter a whole lot. If you\u2019re making a website, look up Webflow, Wix, Squarespace and My Portfolio.

That is fine. Your 2nd and 3rd year are for skill-development, not for burnouts. Don\u2019t compare yourself to other people who seem to have done 56 internships by their 3rd semester. Reject toxic hustle culture and work at your own pace."},{heading:"Apply early.",text:"Do not wait. No portfolio is finished, nobody is perfect. Stop stalling because of perfectionism. Apply by the third week of February at the latest. It takes a good 1.5 months for things to become finalized and you need this buffer to make sure you aren\u2019t stranded with nothing. Early bird becomes an intern."},{heading:"Look for learning not a sweatshop.",text:"A good internship is one where you learn and expand your creative skillset. In your application, state what you can do and what you want to learn. Don\u2019t settle for places that will not challenge you, don\u2019t be stuck doing things that don\u2019t excite you. A lot of places on LinkedIn and Internshala look for help with labour under the guise of internships. Stay away. It is also okay to reject an internship even if you got accepted. Otherwise, you might end up making just social media posts for two months."},{heading:"Get out of LinkedIn hell.",text:'Most places don\u2019t put out internship calls. While LinkedIn, Internshala and company websites are great, they\u2019re not your only source of internships. I got my internship through Twitter. I also emailed nearly 15 people, looked in relevant Slack and Discord channels, cold called, tweeted and nearly sent out a pigeon. Even if a company doesn\u2019t have a listing for an intern, they might create one just for you.
