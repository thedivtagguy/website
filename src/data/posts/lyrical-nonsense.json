{"headline":"Lyricsss Archive is a permanent gallery of projects by students at Srishti.","lede":[{"intro":"Our work at Srishti feels ephemeral. We work on projects for 4 weeks and save an exhibition that might or might not happen, this work remains inside that particular studio or class. Once this class is over, the work of weeks is lost and sits on our hard-drives (and maybe on a Behance profile, if we feel so inclined)."}]}
